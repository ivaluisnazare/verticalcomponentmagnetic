# **magnetic vertical component** :dragon:

Here, i evaluated numerically the vertical component of the magnetic field due to a rectangular coil 
transmitter with variable dimensions, placed on a heterogeneous earth having
N horizontal, homogeneous and isotropic layers. The numerical evaluation process included
the division of each side of the coil in colinear horizontal electric dipole sources, whose
analytical responses are known. The number of divisions of each side was studied.
The behavior of the parameters: amplitude and phase of the field is evaluated as a
function of frequency and the distance between the observation point to the center of the
coil. This evaluation covered situations up to four layers, which allowed us to understand
the relevance of the parameters that modify the magnetic field values when compared to the
homogeneous halfspace case. :snail:
